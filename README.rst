WRF-Fire Wiki
=============

`WRF-Fire <https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/wrf-fire-wildland-fire-modeling>`_ is a two-way coupled atmosphere - wildland surface fire simulation platform within the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) dynamical core. WRF-Fire is a Numerical Weather Prediction model (WRF-ARW) coupled with a semi-empirical fire spread model based on the Rothermelâ€™s semi-empirical Rate of Spread (ROS) model. This Wiki aims to tutor WRF-Fire using a variety of examples with incrementally increasing level of complexity, ranging from basic uncoupled models to nested coupled models in the LES mode. In addition, tutorials are provided on Compiling WRF-Fire on Mac, Compiling WRF-Fire on Linux, Running WRF-Fire, Key WRF-Fire and WRF commands (under development), and Visualization tools.
